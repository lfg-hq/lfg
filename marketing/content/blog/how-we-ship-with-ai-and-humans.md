title: How We Ship Faster With Humans + AI
date: 2026-02-13
excerpt: The delivery model we use to move from idea to production faster without losing engineering quality.

Shipping fast is not about skipping rigor. It is about reducing wasted loops.

At LFG, we run delivery with a split model:

- Humans own product direction, architecture, and release quality.
- AI handles repetitive implementation tasks and draft generation.
- Every ticket is validated before merge.

## What this changes

1. **Less ambiguity early**
   We convert ideas into explicit PRDs and technical plans.

2. **Faster implementation cycles**
   Work is broken into small tickets with clear acceptance criteria.

3. **Higher confidence releases**
   Validation checks run before code is considered done.
